            Before I could understand what it meant to throw myself into the world, I had to lie and omit. My first solo trip was like a secret. I didn’t tell my parents; I told them I was going to Uberlândia to look at apartments. For my grandmother, I made up a school field trip. The truth? I decided to go alone to attend the National Freestyle Battle in Belo Horizonte. It was December 2023. I had little money, no company, no place to stay, but a whole lot of willpower.
        </p>
        <p>
            The night before the event, I stayed at a friend’s place in Uberlândia — that was my starting point. The next day, I hopped on a bus to BH. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Right away, I noticed a guy who seemed to be on the same wavelength. I had a feeling he was going to the same event. I asked if he was going to the Nationals and bingo — he was.
    </p>
    <p>
        We started talking, and I told him I needed a place to drop off my stuff and get ready. He didn’t have a place to stay either, but agreed to look for one with me.

        When we arrived in BH, we tried hotel after hotel — no luck. Everything was booked because of another event happening that day. But a guy at the door of one hotel mentioned there was a motel out back. Honestly, we didn’t have many options. I felt uncomfortable — it seemed suggestive, and I didn’t know the guy well — but I took a chance. We went.

        In the room, we talked a lot and found we had tons in common. He was chill, respectful. The conversation turned into company. We smoked a joint, I got ready, and we headed out. We stopped at the Hippie Fair — huge, vibrant, filled with art, colors, and people — and had acarajé for lunch. Afterward, we walked to Parque Municipal Américo Renné Giannetti, right nearby. The vibe there is great, like an oasis in the middle of the city.
      </p>
      <p>
        Later, we went to the Viaduto Santa Tereza. I had no idea that place would become the setting for many other chapters of my story. The guy from the bus bought us some Xeque Mate (he was paying for everything: the motel, the acarajé, the drink). I didn’t even know what it was — first time trying it — and I was surprised how much I liked it. Since then, it’s become a BH ritual.
      </p>
      <p>
                    It started raining as the day went on, and people huddled under umbrellas. I squeezed under one with a nearby group and ended up hitting it off with them. On the other side, I made friends with another bunch who later invited me to walk around the Sapucaí area and near the viaduct. I went, and the connection was so spontaneous that we still keep in touch today.

             The guy from the bus? He started hitting on me mid-hangout, and I wasn’t into it. I gently said I wasn’t comfortable and drifted away to stick with the new crew. I spent the rest of the day with them.
        </p>
        <p>
            I met MCs, heard rhymes that hit deep, saw raw talent only a place like that could reveal, and felt immersed in all the energy of the event and the city. I felt like I belonged.
        </p>
        <p>
            Near the end of the night, my phone died. No internet either. But I remembered how to get back to the motel and to the bus station. I could already trust my own steps. Given the situation, two of the guys walked me there. I grabbed my stuff, and we walked to the station.
        </p>
        <p>
            It was about 30 minutes of ups and downs with all my weight on my back (this is BH, after all), but I made it. I did the whole walk back exhausted, feet sore, sweaty, probably stinking — but it was worth it.
        </p>
        <p>
            I traveled with almost nothing, no planning, no one by my side. Just grit and guts, taking all the risks. But I came back with stories, new faces, emotional baggage. It was my first solo trip, and also the beginning of a freer version of myself.
        </p>
        <p>
            I came back less afraid of the world. And without knowing it, I was already getting ready to return.
        </p>

            Girl tip: Sometimes a guy pays for everything… but that doesn’t mean you owe him anything at the end of the night.
