        <h1>Get to know me a bit</h1>
        <p>My name is Cecília, I’m 20 years old, a Gemini, an English teacher for the past few years, and a university student majoring in English Language and Literature.</p>
        <p>I consider myself an introvert and don’t like going out unless I’m surrounded by my close friends. But... sometimes we need a breather from everything, and it was through that need that I fell in love with solo travel.</p>
        <p>I share that passion through music, politics, architecture, and photography — and I find all of them in the streets.</p>
        <p>I’m from Patrocínio, Minas Gerais, but I’ve been living in Uberlândia for the past year and a half. Like many others, I face the daily rush, packed buses, and endless bills. Still, amid life’s chaos, I found a way to escape routine with creativity, patience, and very little money.</p>

    <section class="about-extra">
      <p>It’s in every place I visit that I discover new fragments of who I am. As José Saramago once wrote, “you have to leave the island to see the island. We can’t see ourselves unless we step outside ourselves.”</p>
      <p>Traveling allows me to do just that — to step outside, to observe, to understand. Through this blog, I share the fragments of what I see, live, and feel — not as finished stories, but as reflections in motion.</p>
      <p>And maybe, somewhere along the way, you’ll see a reflection of yourself in them too.</p>

    <section class="about-point">
      <h2>What's my point here?</h2>
      <p>My goal goes beyond showing how it’s possible to travel and have fun on a budget. I want to show how amazing it is to just go out there and stumble upon stories that look like mine.</p>
      <p>I also hope to inspire other young women, students, and workers to seek experiences beyond what we're used to, beyond our reality — because all of it is possible, rewarding, and deeply transformative.</p>
