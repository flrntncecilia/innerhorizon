          <h2>An urban manifest</h2>
          <p>Traveling, for me, has never been about luxury. It's about last-minute bookings, sharing a seat with strangers, and finding beauty in the noise of concrete jungles.</p>
          <p>Urban experiences, possible journeys, unlikely encounters, cultural enrichment. In my reality, traveling is an accessible experience. It's crossing cities as if crossing through oneself. I carry these perspectives as a young Brazilian woman, full-time worker, and curious soul who craves real experiences and carries the world in a suitcase.</p>
          <p>This blog was born out of a desire to reaffirm our possibilities in this big world. And if you also feel that there’s more out there waiting beyond the storefronts, then this space is yours too.</p>
          <p>Feel free to dive deep into my horizons.</p>

      <h2>Between the streets</h2>
      <p>Here, the streets are the stage, photography is memory, the mishaps are part of the route, improvisation becomes a path, and freedom is measured in bold steps as we explore spaces filled with countless other stories.</p>
      <p>It’s between the streets that life escapes the script, where maps fail and the gaze discovers. The destination is now, and our privilege is to feel it.</p>
      <p>Welcome to a place where struggle becomes poetry, and the asphalt has a soul.</p>
