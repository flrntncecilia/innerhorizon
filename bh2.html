        <p>It was my return to Belo Horizonte, for another National Battle. A year earlier, I had walked those same neighborhoods. BH was no longer unfamiliar, but each trip writes its own kind of chaos, and this one was no exception. 
        <p>The 2024 Nationals, its 12th edition, came with a new format: two days of event. On Saturday, a sort of press conference with the selected MCs, some battles, and lots of breakdancing. On Sunday, the big showdown.</p>
        <p>I left Uberlândia on a Thursday night, straight from work, still wearing my school uniform. On the bus, I sat next to a woman who, after a stop, asked if I was a teacher. We started talking, and before we knew it, we had spent the night chatting. Her name was Ana. We even found out we had a student in common. It felt like fate had given me another last-minute travel company.</p>
      <p>We arrived in BH Friday morning. This time, I had booked an Airbnb right downtownwn — perfect location.</p>

        <p> At 9 a.m., there was a protest scheduled for the end of the 6x1 work schedule. I made sure to be there, even delayed my trip just to join the manifestation. Fighting for causes is also part of my baggage. I even joined Unidade Popular that day. </p>

      <p>After the protest, I explored Mercado Central. The mix of sounds and smells in those winding corridors was overwhelming. I met up with Ana again, we walked around, talked more, and I invited her to the events. She said yes right away — except for that night, she had other plans.</p>
      <p> When night came, I headed to the viaduct. I met some MCs (and even ran into Chris MC, whom I had met the year before), saw some "clandestine" battles, and once again felt at home in that chaotic, culture-soaked scene.</p>

    <p>
        Saturday, I went back to the viaduct with Ester (a friend I made at the previous Nationals). We attended the press event, met more MCs. I even asked a question to Noventa — my heart nearly jumped out of my chest.
    </p>
    <p>
        Later, I ran into Ana again, now with two girls from Rio who were staying in the same hostel. The vibe with the three of them was light and fun — it felt like we’d been friends forever. We went to a rooftop club called Mira. The view was stunning, but the house music wasn’t really our vibe. Since my Airbnb was less than five minutes away, I walked back.
    </p>
    <p>
        Sunday was the big day. Before heading to the event, Ana and I dropped our bags off at the bus station locker, since I had to check out.
    </p>
    <p>
        Side note: I had booked my Airbnb for the wrong date — until Saturday instead of Sunday morning. Luckily, the host had a small service room available (she was fixing it up to list too), and she let me stay there until noon. An angel.
    </p>
    <p>
        At the event, the place was packed. As we tried to make our way through the crowd, I asked a guy to let us through. When he turned around — no way! He was an old high school friend. We hadn’t seen each other in years. Turns out he now lives in BH and is also studying Literature. It was the kind of coincidence that makes life feel like it’s scripted.
    </p>
    <p>
        We hung out the rest of the afternoon, talking, enjoying the show. Eventually, everyone left one by one. I stayed alone, tired, but there until the end. The winner was a local MC, against Japa from Bahia. Many said it was rigged. I’m still unsure. But honestly? Anyone there deserved to win.
    </p>
    <p>
        After the finals, I found Ester again, joined her group. We wandered the area, laughed, soaked it in. When it was time for me to go, they insisted on walking me to the bus station. Everything was close, so I thought I’d make it. But I didn’t.
    </p>
    <p>
        I realized I wouldn’t make it walking. I started calling Ubers — they kept canceling. Tried again. The bus station had multiple levels, winding paths, weird signage. I got confused, missed one Uber. Another accepted. I got in, said goodbye to the group. And arrived… five minutes late. Missed the bus.
    </p>
    <p>
        I got 80% of the ticket refunded, but the money went to the app wallet, not my bank. And I was broke. Phone dying. Alone. Station closed. Past midnight. I thought about work the next day. What could I do? What were my options? I cried. A lot.
    </p>
    <p>
        I called friends, asked for money, texted Ester to see where she was. I went to meet her, but not for long. A ride share was leaving at 2 a.m. It was my only chance.
    </p>
    <p>
        And it worked. I got back to Uberlândia the next morning, safe and sound. With another story no one could make up — except the messy magic of my own life.
    </p>
    <p>
        If I was proud of making it back alive the first time, this time I came back calmer. I learned that even when things go wrong, the universe finds a way to make them right.
